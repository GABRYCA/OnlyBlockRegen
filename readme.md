Hi guys, this is how to use the plugin

Commands:

/onlyblockadd <While_in_delay_Block>
For example, we want a coal_ore to be become a COBBLESTONE after getting broken, then after about 5 seconds get back to coal_ore, the command will be: /onlyblockadd COAL_ORE COBBLESTONE 5
Simple right?

/onlyblockregen, show all the commands

/onlyblockGUI, open a GUI where you can manage things, like see block and their info and delete all of them.

Permissions:

OnlyBlockRegen.Command-List to use the command /onlyblockregen
OnlyBlockRegen.GUI to open and use the GUI
OnlyBlockRegen.AddBlock to use the /addblock command
OnlyBlockRegen.BreakBlock to break a block (and skip the regeneration of it)
